# Snatcher!

***SNATCHER*** is a tool that helps making a web app to steal someone's info (location only for now) 

It's not a very suitable tool for script kiddies, you should know how to deal with **sqlite3  databases**, i recommend to use ***sqlite3*** pkg

There's **no plans** to add **ngrok** or something like that at all, if you have an another way and you want to share it, **DM me**


So the only way to get it online for now just by using **port forwarding** and hosting it, i recommend using [replit](https://replit.com/).



how to run the tool:

1. you should have python3 installed

2. clone the repo

3. run "cd snatcher/"

4. run "pip install -r reqs.txt"

5. run "python3 app.py"

> things i'll add later (maybe).

* **PHP version** for people have hosting services that support PHP only

* **node js version**

* **CAMERA SNATCH** Let's see how ugly they're

* **browser and device info**

* **an option to add it like XSS payload**
